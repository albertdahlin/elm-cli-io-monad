# IO Monad in Elm

*Just abusing the Elm architecture for fun. This comes with
absolutely no warrany.*

## Running the example

- [example/MyApp.elm](./example/MyApp.elm) is an example application
  written in an IO monad style (like in Haskell).
- You need `node` and `elm make` to run this.
- Run `make` to compile and run an example app.
